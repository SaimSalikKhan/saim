title: "Inside WorkPlus: Building a People‑First HCM Platform"

---

In this inaugural post I want to pull back the curtain on **WorkPlus**, the human capital management platform we’ve been building at Tuscan Consulting. Our goal was simple: create a single source of truth for all people data while making the employee experience delightful. It sounds straightforward, but along the way we encountered thorny data migrations, change‑management challenges and plenty of edge cases. Here are a few lessons learned:

- **Start with empathy.** We conducted workshops with HR teams and frontline employees to map the true pain points in their day‑to‑day work. The resulting insights informed our MVP and prioritisation decisions.
- **Automate the boring stuff.** Time‑consuming tasks like leave approvals and benefits enrolment now take seconds, freeing HR to focus on people strategy.
- **Measure, iterate, repeat.** Built‑in analytics dashboards helped us identify bottlenecks early. We released eight major updates in the first year based on feedback loops.

WorkPlus is still evolving, but the impact has been tangible: happier employees, leaner HR teams and data‑driven decision‑making across the board.
